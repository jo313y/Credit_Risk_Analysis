# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Using data from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the target was to compare oversampling methods, undersampling methods, and combination sampling methods to determine which method works best for predicting credit risk. Next, two other methods that are built to reduce bias will be examined to determine which is better for predicting credit risk. The summary will provide overall what the best method to use for this task.

## Results
- Random Oversampling

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models
## Summary
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
